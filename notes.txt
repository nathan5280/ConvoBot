The objective of the ConvoBot project was to train a convolutional neural
network in a virtual world, and then use that network to control a robot in the
real world.  By leveraging the virtual world, the project was able to overcome
a common network training problem of a lack of labeled images and also explore
how changes in the features in the simulated world impacted different network
models.s

As an example I was able to explore how having stereoscopic images would impact
the networks ability to accurately predict the robots position.  Our own life
experience and intuition suggests that stereoscopic images would produce better
results.  The outcome of the experiment showed no significant improvement in the
predicted position.  Through simulation and 2-days of coding and training I was
able to determine that building out stereoscopic  hardware wasn't worth the
effort or I need to build a different network model.  This type of rapid
prototyping and experimentation in both feature and model space isn't possible
without the use of simulation.

To reinforce the value of this project tonight, listen to how many times you
hear someone say if I only had more LABELED DATA, I could have done X.
